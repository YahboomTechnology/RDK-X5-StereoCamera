# Introduction
D-Robotics RDK StereoCamera is a high-performance binocular depth camera designed for the RDK X5 development platform. It integrates two 2MP color image sensors and supports high-speed output of dual 22PIN MIPI interfaces, providing clear and synchronized binocular vision data. The camera combines an optimized binocular depth algorithm with the help of the RDK X5 BPU unit for efficient reasoning calculations, and can quickly generate accurate depth maps and point cloud data. It is widely used in robot vision, SLAM mapping, 3D reconstruction and other scenarios. It also supports depth data visualization through rviz2 on the PC side, helping developers to intuitively debug and verify the algorithm effect. It is an ideal depth vision solution for scientific research, teaching and engineering projects.
